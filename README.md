# Notification Saver (In Development)

### Overview

**Notification Saver** is a work-in-progress Android application built with Flutter. The app aims to help users manage and retrieve notifications they may have missed or accidentally dismissed. The final product will allow users to store, categorize, filter, and prioritize notifications, using machine learning to sort notifications by their importance.

- Assign apps to categories.
- Display notifications in categories with filters.

#### Task 3: Machine Learning Integration (To Be Implemented)

- Enable users to rate notifications to help the model improve.
- Push notifications for important messages.
